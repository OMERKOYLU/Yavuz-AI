# Yavuz AI, Open Source Chess AI Project

Yavuz is a chess ai which has been developing by Ömer Köylü since 2021, I used genethic algoritm for train it and also get help off game theory, minmax algorithm and alpha beta pruning to make it faster.

Initially appeared on
[git](https://github.com/OMERKOYLU/Yavuz-AI).

## Getting Started

These instructions will give you a copy of the project up and running on
your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment
for notes on deploying the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

Requirements for the software and other tools to build, test and push 
- Only requirement is php running server for run train script on browser.
- if you want to play against Yavuz you must have compatible browser(to run javascript code).

### Installing

first the step will be
    - install php 7.0 server on your machine
    - enter the directory *www/public_html*

and then run the following command on your *terminal* at your **public_html** directory

    - git clone https://github.com/OMERKOYLU/Yavuz-AI

[near there will be image that shows running code]

## Running the tests

    After installing project if you want to run train script you must visit **http://localhost/Train/start_to_train.html**
    
    if you want to play a game against Yavuz you must visit **http://localhost/Game/play.html**
